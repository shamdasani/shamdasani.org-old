### Welcome to the 2019 Annual Report

**What a decade.** Where do I even _start_?

Well, I just finished my first semester at Michigan. It's been an amazing four months. I've met so many talented people, learned a ton, and experienced part of all that college has to offer.

Although I've missed my family and friends from back home, I've also enjoyed college life. While the food is alright and the dorms aren't nothing like home, the new experiences and friends make up for it!

But to be honest, I still just can't believe it. I'm 18, *officially* an adult. Everything's flying by.

Here are some metrics over the past year:

<p class="stat"><span>599</span> miles run </p>
<p class="small">I only recieved my GPS watch halfway throughout the year, so this doesn't speak for all my mileage! My total elevation gain was 25, 908 ft. (.9 of Mt. Everest!), which is pretty cool to look back at. </p>

<p class="stat"><span>142</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/samaysham">tweets</a> </p>
<p class="small">with 82k impressions and hundreds of engagements</p>

<p class="stat"><span>8</span> <a href="https://instagram.com/samaysham">instagram</a> posts </p>
<p class="small">#influencer</p>

<p class="stat"><span>37,337</span> minutes listened on spotify </p>
<p class="small">I share my account with my sister (sooo can't share my "top" artists here...)</p>


<p class="stat"><span>5</span> books read </p>
<p class="small">(Meditiations, When Breath Becomes Air, How to Win Friends, 12 Rules for Life, Sapiens) I've invested my time in many blogs and podcasts, but did some reading too. I'd like to focus on reading more in 2020 (1 book/month).</p>

<p class="stat"><span>365</span> journal entries </p>
<p class="small">This was my first year journalling! I'm so glad I did it and will countinue to do so. I started in October 2018 (early in my Senior year) on a Google Doc, but transitioned to a physical journal shortly thereafter.</p>

Since I was in the 7th grade, I've been shoveling driveways with friends — earning anywhere from a couple hundred to a thousand every season. It's how I bought my drone, computer, and camera! I won't be able to continue as I'll be in college every winter for the next four years.
