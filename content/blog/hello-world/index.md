Hey there! I’m **Samay**. Welcome to my very first post!
Of my infinite thoughts, some are worth sharing.

## About me

I’m a 16 year old developer based in New Jersey, USA. Of all things, I absolutely love technology. I’m definitely more of a front-end developer, but I’ve been experimenting with lower level stuff recently such as machine learning algorithms in Python.

I also run nearly everyday. You could probably find me exploring our planet, appreciating the breathtaking beauty that nature has bestowed on us.
Please feel free to contact me anytime. I love meeting new people and I’m always open for new opportunities: samay@shamdasani.org
